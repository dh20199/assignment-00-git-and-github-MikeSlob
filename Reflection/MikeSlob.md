# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out reflection on the assignment.

## Question 1
### In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists.

#For the purposes of a history course, it would make sense to use this type of format to construct flashcards, whether of historical events, people or places. For a more research oriented project, this layout could be used to store information to certain "cards" in order to keep this research organized. For example, a historian researching the events leading up to the outbreak of the 2nd World War could have several sets of cards: one set on events, another on key figures, another on places, social climates, etc…. Then on the individual cards, the historian could fill in information they discover through their research relevant to the card topic.

## Question 2
### This assignment asks you all to perform a certian amount of work (describing yourselves) in order to improve a project (the course roster website). What responsibilities does the "researcher" (in this case, your teacher) have to the participants (you)? What rights do or should the participants have to the end product? 

#Given that the layout, structure and else everything but personal information, was set out by the Professor, the Professor should hold the rights to the actual code. While some editing is done by us students, in the end we are not the original creators of this code, so we should not have any right to the end product. However, the personal info put into the cards is our own. So the Professor should be liable to ensuring the protection of said information to the best of their ability. Furthermore, absent any legal agreement, the Professor should be expected to remove the personal information or allow the student to remove their personal information if they so desire at any time.

## Question 3
### Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of data structure imposes on your project?

#For the aforementioned purpose of a history research project, "fields" could include "date/place of birth", "family", 'upbringing", "political roles", "historical significance" to name a few. A limitation of this method is that it requires breaking down aspects of historical figures/places/events when, as any historian will tell you, history is far too complex to break down into a simple story. Furthermore, there are many overlapping aspects of history, so trying to break everything down into “cards” may result in either redundant information or in missing information.
